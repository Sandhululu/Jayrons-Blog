                   Where to even begin man. Played this for the first time in 2019. Progress was quite slow the first 
                   time I played. I eventually completed the game though what a banger. The character development
                   and dynamic between Atreus and Kratos is so beautiful to watch. Regardless of that Atreus 
                   is still really fucking annoying and Kratos is so fucking cool. The dark elves in this game
                   are so fucking annoying. Also the variety in boss enemies is severely lacking. I heard that was due 
                   to not much funding to the game though. The RPG mechanics of this game were cool as well. I didn't think
                   the game was too hard on my second playthrough. On my first one I remember it being so hard.
                   On my second go I did the trials and did the Valkyries with Hari and Matthew and it was really fun 
                   to rage together lol. Very satisfying to kill the valkyries though. I played the second run through
                   so I could get ready for Ragnarok dropping on PC but the Minecraft phase got in the way of playing lmfao.
