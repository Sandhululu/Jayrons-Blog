                This book provided a great insight into how life was in the gulag. It was a difficult read 
                due to the harsh conditions that the prisoners were subjected to. In a fucked up way 
                I feel much more appreciative of everything I have in the 21st century regardless of the numerous
                problems in the world. The detail that this book goes into is insane. It is quite difficult
                to visualise the work that they do but the message and the horror of it is conveyed very well.
                This book is a clear reminder of what can happen when power is centralised around one singular person.
                The way that the gulags systematically break down the prisoners sense of self worth and also 
                pit each other against each other is fascinating. All these little things have created this 
                ecosystem that has rid humans of any humanity. Its the systematic nature of the gulags that is the 
                most horrifying. I shoudln't really compare these things but Stalin and Hitler had a lot in common  
                despite being on opposing ends of the political spectrum. Both had a stranglehold on every part of 
                soceity and created a cult of personality that allowed for horrible atrocities to occur. And I would 
                argue that Stalin destroyed any hope I ever had in Communism.
