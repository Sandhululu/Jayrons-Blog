                    I was interested in reading this because it's made by Jason's grandad Brian and also 
                    because it's quite an early work in science fiction, so I was hoping for a fresh 
                    perspective on Science Fiction. This book definitely gave me a fresh perspective. 
                    The setting is definitely the best part of this book. It is set some point long into 
                    the future after a cosmic event that caused the sun to be in sync with the moon. 
                    This caused half the world to be in eternal sunshine and the other half to be eternally 
                    dark. Due to the eternal sunshine, hothouse conditions were formed and the plant world 
                    took over the human world.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The most fascinating bit of this book is seeing mankind no longer be the apex predator. 
                    Another cool plant is the traverser which is like a huge spider that can travel between 
                    the Earth and the Moon. However, due to the setting-based story front, I felt that 
                    character development was left on the side. There are some interesting interactions 
                    between the Morel and Gren and how this affected his relationship with Poyly and then 
                    Yattmur. But other than that, the whole Lily-yo starting and them becoming flymen and 
                    their quest is completely ignored throughout the book.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To conclude this was a very creative book which has a very rich setting full of lots of imagination
                    but the plot and character writing left much to be desired.
