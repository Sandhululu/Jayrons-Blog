                    Got this book recommendation from Emma Likeman. I should have defo read it earlier than I actually
                    did but oh well. Also this is Elly's favourite book so I wanted to read it and talk to her about
                    it before I see her for 4AM Kru
                </p>
                    You can definitely tell that this is a Murakami book there is something about his prose that 
                    is very unique. The main similarity this has to Kafka On the Shore is the philosophical undertones
                    present during the book. This was a very heavy and a sad book to the say the least. It definitely
                    impacted me more than those emotions to I used previously but i'm not too sure how to describe
                    my emotions in words.

                    This book had me just as confused as Watanabe for most of it. It perfectly encapsulates the chaos
                    and the wierdness of love in your early 20s. The main outcome I took from the Naoko story is that 
                    no matter how much you want to help someone it's ultimately up to them to try there best and 
                    sometimes the best just isn't enough. However attempts should still be tried no matter what I 
                    believe that Watanabe really did love Naoko and tried his best but he lost the ability to look after 
                    himself and became very reliant on Midori. It's wierd that even before Naoko died it still seemed
                    that Naoko herself was dead yet Watanabe stayed hooked as long as he could. I find this very honourable
                    but also it distracts him from the pain he instills on Midori and how obviously Midori wants to be
                    with him. In a fucked up way Naoko rubs off so much on Watanabe that he ends up just like and the roles
                    are completely reversed with Midori desperate to have Watanabe open up to her and Watanabe shutting off
                    just like Naoko closes herself from Watanabe and cant stopm that.

                    This book had me feeling strange nostalgia towards my own past relationship even though that was
                    so long ago. I think thats where some of the personal beauty comes from despite obviously not having
                    the same experience as Watanabe some of his problems deeply resonated with me. Reiko's ending
                    conversation to Watanabe is what I will take away from this book. Always remember sweet past memories
                    but don't let the rush of nostalgia blind you from what you currently have in the present.
