               Watched this hungover after the conducta rave so probably missed a lot of the small details. Really good 
               acting Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. The best bit of this movie was definitely the end with 
               how Spacey's villain controlled the entirety of the movie and even the end as well. Once it became 
               clear what was going to happen I felt bad for Pitt's character but due to how his character was developed
               throughout the movie it was clear that he was going to kill him. This movie addressed many fascinating themes
               throughout in particular, the 7 deadly sins, complacency and denial, martrydom. The depth of the characters 
               and how they relate to these earlier mentioned themes is the undeniably biggest strength. You know a movie 
               is good when you go to youtube after to see all the little small details and character breakdown that you missed.
