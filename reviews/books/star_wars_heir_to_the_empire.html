                    Was inspired to read some star wars legends books after watching a fuck tonne of star wars content
                    recently. I saw online that the thrawn series is one of the best star wars books so I thought I would 
                    check it out. Thrawn is so fucking cool. The way he reads situations as well as his machievellianism 
                    is so good. The fact that he studies a societies art to understand how they think and therefore 
                    read their actions is so good. I was also impressed that this book made me actually rate the 
                    original trilogy characters in particlarly Luke,Leia and Han. I didn't expect myself to be interested 
                    in the characters from the original trilogy but I was. I'm hoping the next book goes into more 
                    detail on Joruus C'baoth and the fact that he is a clone that is dark jedi. This book is especially
                    good because it really explands on the original trilogy and is able to introduce new characters and 
                    locations and still retain the original trilogy feel. Also big up Lando the goat. I want to rewatch
                    the original trilogy now.
