                    Started reading this book on the train to Leeds to meet Mac for Tom's house party. I would say that it's split 
                    into three parts. The first part establishes the characters very well as well as establishing mysteries around 
                    the characters. In particular it sets up the themes of loneliness and unrequited love that are heavily explored 
                    later. The second part is where Sumire goes missing and K goes to Greece to figure out what has happened. Here we 
                    see more of K's character shine and the book gets a lot more Murakami with it's wierdness and surrealism. Which once 
                    again Murakami does an excellent job of allowing me to fully picture the settings. Then the third part of the story 
                    follows on with the aftermath of Sumire going missing and how it impacts the main characters.

                    The title of this book drew me to the book as I love Russian History. I have a few theories on 
                    the 'Sputnik' aspect of the title. Sputnik in English translates to companion and in a literal sense 
                    Sumire accompanies Miu throughout their travels but also in a more metaphorical sense 
                    when Sumire dissapears K and Miu lose a part of themselves and I believe that Murakami is saying 
                    that the lost parts of K and Miu are the ones that accompany Sumire on her travels. Also Sputnik being 
                    a sattelite that is gravitationally attracted to the earth, has to have a deeper meaning. I think 
                    this is where the unrequited love comes in. K(sputnik) requires Sumire(earth) to survive and be himself
                    and when he loses that earth he comes crashing back in. And its the realisation from Sumire(sputnik) and 
                    Miu(earth) that Sumire can't be sexually in love with Miu because of what happens in her past. 
                    Miu's tragic story is Murakami's surrealism at it's finest.
                <p>
                  To finish this review of I love how differently different people can interpret the book. I wonder if 
                  I read this book in the future that I will see the book entirely different as I have changed and therefore 
                  my interpretations on everything could change. Man I love the way these books make me think.
