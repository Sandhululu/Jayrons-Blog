                    This the all time goat man. I could write all day about these books. Read them the first time 
                    when I was 10 which tbf looking back is hella impressive. Bought this book again during 1st
                    year because I really wanted to get back into reading again and spend a little bit of time
                    by myself. I read some while I was at Hull in the RCH and a bit in Anne Lister but I think I 
                    only got 200 pages in...
                </p>
                     I don't wanna glaze this book too much but man is it so much better than the movies. And the movies 
                    are my favourite movies of all time. There is not a dull moment in this book ever. The best 
                     thing about Tolkien is his rich way to describe the surroundings in particular I found the chapters
                    in Moria to be so fucking cool. As well as this it's so immersive and in particular the masculinity
                    that is presented through the characters is peak masculinity. I don't even think it would be a 
                     bad idea to look towards any of the characters in this book and find really honourable traits
                     that we could all do better. Just man I don't even know how to talk more about this book without making 
                     it wayyyy too long. 10/10 Greatest Book of All Time.
