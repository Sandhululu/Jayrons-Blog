                  Started playing this game a long long time ago. Literally bought a PS4 to play this game. I don't think
                  I got very far through this game at all and I don't really remember why I didn't play. Then I gave
                  this game another opportunity just before Uni. I remember enjoying it and did sink quite a bit of
                  time into it but never got back to it after going back to Uni. Finally decided to pick this game back up
                  in Summer 2024. First of all this game has an amazing premise. It's this hella wierd dystopian yet
                  primitive game where Humanity has returned to tribalism after being really technologically advanced.
                  I though this game presented interesting looks into tribalism and the early onset of religion. In 
                  particular it's clear how wierd these tribal rules are as well as how much coincidence(FATE) plays a 
                  key role in everything.

                Aloys growing up and story is very fun to play through and also very sad. RIP ROST TRUE GOAT. I enjoyed
                figuring out more about the old world and in particular I really enjoyed adventuring and seeing the lost
                relics of a bygone error. Also the combat was very fun I enjoyed figuring out the optimal way to kill
                different beasts and seeing all the really cool dinosaur robot things. Taking some time away from this 
                series before I play Forbidden West. This is also the first game in a long long time that I got
                100% in.
