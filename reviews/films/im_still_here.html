                    I'm Still Here is set in 1970s Brazil and showcases the impacts a military dictatorship can have on a family.
                    Cried a couple of times watching this one in the cinema. The film starts of all rosy and shows how good
                    they have it living next to the beach and coming from a family where Rubens Paiva was once a senator. 
                </p>

                <p>One day  Rubens is taken away and armed men stay in the house. Following on from this Eunice Paiva and one of her daughters
                    are taken to prison. The inhumane conditions are shown and it really was difficult watching this. Eventually
                    Eunice is allowed to go home and I think this was probably the most difficult part of the movie to watch.

                    Going home and trying to put on a brave face around her children to try not to worry them while she is losing it.
                    Even during all this she is still being watched and it's shown that one of the watchers even inadvertently
                    kills the family dog. The hardest bit was when she finds out that Rubens is unofficially dead and still takes
                    the kids out for the ice cream and you can really see the hurt she has when she looks around at other happy families
                    and the jealousy is clear on her face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The movie then goes on to show just how difficult it was to get her the 
                    official death record and how Eunice dedicated her life to human rights defence of indigenous peoples. This movie
                    showed perfectly the climate of fear that is created when far left/right power is allowed to manifest itself
                    in the courts, police and military.
