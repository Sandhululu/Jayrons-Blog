                This tv show is only 4 episodes long. Each episode focusing on a different group of people.
                The cinematography of this tv show is the high point as well as some good performances by the 
                actors. In particular the kid actor who plays the main actor really did a good job of making
                people hate him. Reminds me a bit of Jack Gleeson but not quite as good. The fact that the episodes are 
                recorded in one take is also hella good. Definitely a tear jerker this one. In particular seeing
                the impact of this kids actions on the ones around him and the affected. Where this tv show falls 
                short is that it doesn't explain very much why the kid does what he does. Apparently he murders the girl 
                because of some mean comments on his instagram. Like thats a bit far fetched. Would have definitely been 
                a better watch if it went more into what caused the kid to do the murder. Feels like it was made more 
                for the older generations who have no idea what an incel/online stuff works.
