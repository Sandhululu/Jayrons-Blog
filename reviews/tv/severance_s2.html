                10/10 Absolute cinema. I don't know how to keep this one short lol. This tv show lives in 
                my head rent free. I can't remember the last time I was this obsessed with something. There is so much
                going on every episode. The theories are bat shit crazy. The season finale had me so engrossed I 
                could not believe that 75 minutes had gone by. I really didn't want it to end. Sadie was moaning
                that the season finale wasn't that good and that she won't be watching season 3(She should devour feculence)
                but I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion(wrong opinion). Milchick further cemented his position
                as the goat but there is still much I wanna know about him. The cinematography matches the high standards
                of season 1. Woes Hollow, Chickhai Bardo and the season finale were the high points of the season. Also
                was really nice to watch this with Clint and have him over. Love that guy.
