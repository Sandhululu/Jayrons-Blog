                    Where to even begin with this banger. Thank you Finlay for recommending this to me.
                    Im so glad I watched this. The idea of this tv show is that some workers for a corporation
                    called Lumen work on the severed floor. These employees are severed. They go under a procedure
                    called severance in which a chip is planted into their brains. This chip when entering the severed floor
                    turns on and the brain switches to the innie which has no knowledge of the outie and vice versa when
                    leaving the severed floor   
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everything about this tv show slaps. I love the dystopian theme and the idea that we have 
                    no idea what Lumen actually do. The characters are all really funny in particular Dylan and 
                    Mr Milchick are the goats. The party where Mr Milchick is dancing and Dylan loses it is 
                    my favourite scene in the entire thing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The rest of the characters also have good side plots. With Ern and Burt, Helly trying to kill
                    herself, and dylans desire to know more about his outie. This season ends in the best way with the 
                    plot twist that Helly's outie is actually Helaena Eagan as well as Marks outie finding out
                    that his wife is Mrs Casey and that she is alive on the severed floor.
