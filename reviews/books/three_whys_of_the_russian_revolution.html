                   This book looks over three seperate questions. Why did tsarism fall? 
                   Why did the Bolsheviks gain power? Why did Stalin succeed Lenin? This book was good at giving
                   a concise analysis of each of these questions. It also presents itself as an alternative history and 
                   the author does not hide his own opinions which allows for an entertaining read. If this was a long 
                   analysis it would have got a better rating. A good introduction into soviet history. Also lots of good 
                   quotes in here that give an idea into the person Lenin was with some biased attached.
