               Watched this for the first time with Brendan in 2019 enjoyed it but found the movie to be very confusing.
               On the first watch I still found Joules(Sam L Jackson) to be very funny and soooooo cool. I watched
               this movie for the second time with Alicia in Anne Lister. Very memorable experience and I remember
               enjoying the movie much more this time. This watch was the 3rd time watching it. This time I watched
               it with Hari. Hari said he was rating this the same as Inglorious Basterds after watching it.
            </p>
                I still think Joules is so fucking cool. So many memorable scenes and quotes. Also Vincent (John Travolta)
                has this funny arrogance about him that perfectly complements Jules chill vibes. The 
                casualness of this movie is what makes it amazing as well as the well though out dialogue
                that keeps you on your toes. The Butch(Bruce Willis) section is also quite good I don't enjoy it as much
                as Jules and Vincent's arc but still good. 
            </p>
                Memorable scenes include getting the briefcase, Vincent dancing with Mia, Mia Oding, Butch bumping into 
                Marsellus, The wolf and the final scene in the diner.
