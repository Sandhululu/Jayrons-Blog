                    Started reading this book after finishing Sputnik Sweetheart wanted to continue the Murakami vibes.
                    This books starts more on the mysterious side and has you questioning the main character. In particular
                    the first part of the book showing him meet this girl who he likes because of her ears is so 
                    fucking weird I love it. It does what I feel Murakami does best and thats making you question 
                    everything that is going on because it seems so strange. This book did the magical realism really 
                    well. Not as good as Kafka but still better than the other Murakami I've read. The title of 
                    the book literally describes what the book is about lol a wierd sheep chase that takes the main 
                    character to hokkaido. The description of the locations is so vivid I could really picture it.
                    It had the classic tone of Murakami as well very slow and then crescendos at the end leaving 
                    unanswered questions as well as answering some that only lead to more questions. I really wish 
                    there was someone else I knew who had read this book to discuss it because thats one of the 
                    thing I think that makes GoT so special. The online community is goated and Murakami doesn't really have that.
                    I think this is my second favourite Murakami book after Kafka and just reminds me how amazing 
                    writers minds are.
