                    Started reading this book on the train to Manchester to WHP. Started of quite slow but was very
                    intriguing at the same time. The book centers around two different characters for it's duration.
                    Kafka Tamura runs away from home due to suffering with terrible prophecies bestowed upon him by
                    his father. He is only 15 and runs away in search for his mother and sister that left him at a 
                    young age. His journey takes him to Takamatsu where he meets Sakura and Oshima at the library.
                    The library is owned my Miss Saeki who is shy and reserved. Kafka starts to have intimate dreams
                    of being with the past version of Miss Saeki and becomes obsessive with her. The book and Kafka's 
                    part in it become very metaphysical and really make me think about how bat-shit crazy this book is.
                    Probably need to read this book again in more detail. I sped through it when I got hooked because
                    I was desperate to know how it ends lol.

                    The second character it follows is Nakata. A man who cant read and is very simple due to 
                    a childhood accident. His super power is that he can talk to cats. He looks for a missing cat and
                    this brings him into contact with Jonny Walker who he kills after having a mental break. He
                    tries to confess but isn't taken seriously. He then goes on the run where he meets Hoshino
                    a truck driver who takes well to Nakata and helps him with his quest to find the stone. Hoshino
                    late at night goes out and bumps into Colonel Sanders who apppears to be some like god or deity or
                    something like that he takes Hoshino to the stone. Nakata then talks to the stone and some magic happens.
                    This all happens in Takamatsu parralel to Kafka's story. The highlight of this bit is the chapters
                    from Hoshinos perspective which paint a man trying to make up for his previous wrongs and 
                    explores how music can bring people together. This is clearest when he talks to Oshima at the library.

                    To finish of this review I just want to re-itterate just how bat shit crazy this book is and I loved it.
                    My only critique is probably that it started off a bit slow but if I just actually read more often that
                    probably woudn't have been an issue lol. After reading this I then went and bought 3 more Murakami books.
