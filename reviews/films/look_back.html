                This is a very beautiful film the animation and the settings are beautiful. The score is quite nice as well
                perhaps a bit too melodramatic for me. There are some parts that are really otp and therefore a bit cringey
                to me. This movie explored concepts of fate I think this had much to do with divine wind due to the movie
                and the fact that it is Japanese. As well as this friendship/best friendship was addressed this was quite
                cute tbf. I don't really understand the alternate timeline stuff at the end. I guess it's to show the 
                concept of the butterfly effect and that no matter what happens they are fated to meet. Giving this a 7.5
                because it's a beautifully animated film but it can be cringey and fake deep. After looking on Youtube
                I think most of the hype comes from around the concept of why we make art but that doesn't resonate
                with me.
