                    Another beautiful game this time the art style is what really shines. More of a small scale cyberpunk 
                    vibe which shows the decay post cyberpunk success. On the surface you could play this game
                    and just think its a cute cat game. Which it is and I enjoyed the simplicity of the gameplay a lot
                    but also there is a rich social commentary going on. Showing the consequences of what can happen
                    when Humanity goes too far allowing itself to be divided by class. Only took me 5 hours to finish this 
                    game but man was I invested. Cried at the end as well such a beautfiul climax. Also the robots
                    were cute. The greatest success of this game is making me rate cats a little bit. It's still always
                    gonna be dogs>cats.
