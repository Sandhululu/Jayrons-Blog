                 This game is really really cool as a couch coop game. Probably took me and Hari about 15-20 hours to complete.
                 The story isn't the strongest but definitely pulls its weight. I can see why Hari's character was their as a contrast to Mio
                 who was definitely the cooler character with cooler stories. But my god was Hari's character annoying for like 
                 3/4 quarters of the game. Some of her stories were really cool tho. Particularly because I always got to fly and Hari ended up
                 with the other shit skill loool. I enjoyed Mio's stories most tho due to their sci-fi, dystopian cyberpunky aesthetic. 
                 The platforming and puzzle solving was also so fun. It was the right level of difficulty, requiring some level of thought
                 but not having to sit there for hours trying to figure it out. The side stories were all really cool and the
                 studio who made this game were so creative. Do not think i'm gonna play a game like this again anytime soon. 
                 Many memories were made playing this game and I will definitely cherish all of them.
