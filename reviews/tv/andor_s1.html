            Season starts of pretty slow but man when it picks up it really picks up.
            The best way to summarise is that this is proper adult star wars which 
            doesn't shy away from the horrors of imperial rule. This season 
            really fleshes out the characters and the world building giving a lot of insight into the rebellion before Yavin 4. The Aldhani, Prison and the final arc
are the peaks of the season. The focus on the ISB and Luthen rail is so good.
The monologue Luthen gives in the elevator is so cool. Also syril is really funny.
Cant wait for season 2.
