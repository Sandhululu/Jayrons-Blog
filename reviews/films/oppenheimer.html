              Man where to even begin with this movie what a BANGER. Watched it two times in the cinema and each time
              it was just as good if not better each time I watched it. Watched it first with Beelo then with Kav, Jas and 
              Sharan. Just watched it for the third time with Hari and Sadie. Man that film looked gorgeous in the cinema 
              especially in the cinema when the bomb goes off and its just silent. The anticipation is built up so well
              and the frantic phase of the movie displays how urgent it was for the Americans to develop the atomic
              bomb. It even looked good on the shitty tv in my uni gaff. The only criticisms I have are that the third act
              is very long and that it is very easy to forget who each person is as the cast is HUGE. But this is 
              most of the time a positive of the movie. I love that Nolan took the time to actually represent all the 
              physicists there. As a nerd I loved that. I think this movie does a great job showing the red scare/Mcarthyism.
              The highlight is Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and the way they showed just how much of a moral dilemma he had. As well 
              as how easy it is to paint him as a villain despite the fact that he is trying to do the best for mankind that he 
              can do. Will defo make sure to check this one out again next time it hits the cinema or on the home setup.
