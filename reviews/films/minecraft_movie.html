              This shit was straight ass. I loved it. As a movie this sucks I have no idea what the characters were 
              called. I get that Jack Black is for kids but he is so cringe. The references to minecraft are so 
              cringe that it is actually really funny. The character development and stakes are non existent. Nick was
              so locked in fair play to him. Watching Mac watch this was actually some of the funniest shit I have 
              ever watched. Towards the end he got so bored and went on his phone bruh. The actual animals 
              villagers and the setting was actually really faithful and looked good. But having it be live action 
              ruined it. Also wtf happened to Jason Momoa seeing him as Khal Drogo and then in this movie gave 
              me severe whiplash. Like how the fuck is this the same actor. Anyway greatest movie of all time.
