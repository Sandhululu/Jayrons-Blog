             This movie was really funny in particularly the joke about hating pikeys was funny the numerous times it was used.
             The biggest strength of this movie is its ability to have loads of different characters and be able to juggle the
            the interactions between all of them to make a coherent and funny plot. Brad Pitt surprised me the most in this
            as his accent wasn't actually that bad and he played the role really well. Bonus points for the really
            cool deagle one of the characters has.
