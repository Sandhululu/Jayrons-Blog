                    This game is absolutely gorgeous playing this at home 4K with the surround sound system was absolutely
                    amazing. Was insanely immersive. I just love the cyberpunk dystopian future vibes. You can tell that cyberpunk 
                    fiction and this video game are inspired by early 80s and 90s Japanese visions of what the future would look 
                    like. The big neon signs the massive mega corporations. Arasaka clearly being samsung but on steroids. As well 
                    as the Militech and all the other factions. So much complexity and purposefully made lore is what makes
                    it insanely immersive. This might be the only game ever where I actually read all the collectibles and 
                    got deeply in love with the world. This immersion was perfect for taking me out of reality over the summer after 
                    second year. Definitely needed that.

                    The first time I played this game is so different to the second time I played. Wow this game was shite at
                    release it was a buggy mess and I could barely even run it. Flash forward 2 and a half years ago and 
                    i'm running it at 4k with some upscaling and barely saw any glitches. The best bit about the release of this 
                    game was all the amazing youtube videos shitting on the game. So glad it's had a redemption arc and I need to
                    play again since they released Phantom Liberty and overhauled the skill tree.

                    The side characters as well as V and Jonny Silverhand were really memorable. I'm still down bad for Panam.
                    The Panam quests had me feeling some kinda way. I accidentally did the panam bad ending so I had to load
                    back to an earlier save to get the better ending. Also really enjoyed the interactions between Kerry Eurodyne
                    and Jonny was great to get the Samurai back together. Will definitely have to update this next time I play as it
                    has been almost 2 years already since I last played.
