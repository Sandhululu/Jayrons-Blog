           As a kid this was my favourite star wars movie I used to watch this over and over again. Then when I watched 
           it in 2020 during covid I just thought it was a bit shit tbf. Flash forward to 2025 and I haven't watched it since
           covid and its released in the cinema so I go to watch it with Clint. Wow this movie looked really good 
           in the cinema does not look like 2005 at all the special fx were gorgeous. I didn't think that Anakins fall to
           the dark side was as abrupt this time like you can see the separate events that cause it mostly fear of
           losing padme but it doesn't feel like it's all tied up together. The fighting scenes as well I don't think
           have aged too well like the choregraphy of the lightsaber battles and the amount of cuts do not reflect well.
           The sound of the lightsabers tho in the cinema was so fucking cool. Also Padme is a bit annoying but also 
           really hot so I guess it is what it is. Obi wan is really cool and I used to think that Mace Windu was the coolest
           he still is really cool but I think Yoda is so much cooler now. There are some huge plot holes in the writing 
           mostly to do with Anakin and Palpatine. It's so obvious that Palpatine is the sith lord and Anakin just does
           nothing about it because he doesn't trust the jedi and is mad that they don't trust him but I guess he is 
           a teenager so that kind of excuses it. Anyway RIP Kit Fisto you were a real one.
