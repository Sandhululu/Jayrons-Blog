                    Bought this to play on Macs switch in second semester. And man this game had me hooked and it was 
                    all I thought about during Exam SZN. I woudn't play throughout the week then I would spend all my
                    weekends playing. Despite this I didn't actually end up completing the game because post exams
                    I was actually quite burned out. And also it was the last month in York for so many of my friends
                    so I really wanted to get as much time as I possibly could with the Boys.
                  
                </p>
                    I think the greatest part of this is how good the art style and the game look even though it's on
                    the Nintendo Switch which specs wise is ASS. In terms of gameplay I really enjoyed that I didn't 
                    have to do the main quest and actually barely did lol. I spent most of my time playing this game
                    going places where I shoudn't go and then getting one hit. I found this to be the funnest way to play
                    the game. The boss fights were also very engaging because I made them hard by being severely underlevelled.
                    Also I enjoyed the cheffing and the fact that your weapons break so you have to keep using new stuff.
                    I should go back and complete the story but I don't really think thats the point of the game. Lots of character
                    and had me hooked even during exam SZN 10/10 might make me buy a switch just to play this lol.
