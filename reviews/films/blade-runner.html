               The first thing I don't understand about this movie is that it got a 8.1 on IMDB. Perhaps my harshness
               is due to reading the book and therefore having heightened expensions. The setting is a lot different 
               to the book but is probably the best thing about the movie. To say it was released in 1982 it looks 
               spectacular. Thats where the compliments end unfortunately.

                The pacing of this movie was horrendous. I feel like nothing happened throughout the movie
                and the decision to show Deckard as having difficulties with his job through alcohol didn't hit the mark.
                He is also terrible at his job lol. He has so much plot armour. The questions that really had me thinking
                in the book are non existent. Where is the Mercerism, Mood box, Mood Organs, Electric animals. There is no 
                reason for Deckard to go retire the androids. This movie disapointed so much. Hopefully Blade Runner 2049 does a
                better job. One final point is the change from the book on Luba Luft the opera singer and the consequences
                of this. Also no robot sex what the hell.
