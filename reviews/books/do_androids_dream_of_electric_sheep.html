                    Not a very big book but I managed to bash this out in 2 days. The first time I watched the Blade Runner
                    movie I fell asleep and found it really confusing lol. Got inspired to read this after finishing
                    cyberpunk 2077 a couple of years ago. 
                    
                </p>

                    The book follows a bounty hunter called Rick Deckard who takes over the chief bounty hunter in 
                    taking out some rogue androids. To determine whether they are human or android the voight-kamff test
                    is taken this is done to test the empathy levels and natural reactions to vocal stimuli. The primary
                    religion/philisophy of the world is mercerism which is based on empathy and looking after animals.
                    Hence the title of the book being about electric sheep because Rick bought a fake after his real one
                    died due to him mishandling some hay. 
               
                <p>
                    Where the book really grabbed me is the mood organ. This can be dialed to give the user
                    whatever emotions and feelings they want. This lack of real emotion is what really makes this 
                    book super dystopian. As well as the dust that causes everything to be full of kipple
                    and constant decay. 
             
                </p>
                    The story of this book confused the fuck out of me lol. Is Rick actually an android? Can androids
                    feel emotions and therefore pass the tests? Is anything ever actually real or is it all a matter of 
                    perspective? Whats the point of retiring these androids if they aren't malicious? Can we really tell
                    what is real and what is fake? Overall this book really made me think about empathy and how
                    humans emotionally process things. 
               
                <p>
                    In conclusion this book was wierd I loved every bit of it and empathy is one confusing and 
                    paradoxical concept. What is reality and how much control do we have in shaping our own
                    realities? Also the chickenhead chapters made me a little sad man. How could someone be treated
                    so differently just because they didn't pass the IQ tests?
