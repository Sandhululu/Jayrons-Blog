                This season was so good definitely much better than S2 and i'm not sure yet if it is better than season 1
                but the fact that it is even a debate speaks wonders about how good this season was. I enjoyed this 
                season because it was a lot more character driven and also put a lot more emphasis on the side characters.
                In particular RexSplode's character arc was very good this season. I just hope they don't ressurect him.
                Thats one of two issues I had with Invincible. Characters always get ressurected and it makes 
                everyone seem invincible. And also the 5th episode about pinhead and the whole crime syndicate stuff 
                wasn't very interesting and is definitely the low point of this season. Episodes 2,6,7,8 were definitely 
                the highlights of the season. Ep 2 delved into Cecils backstory. Ep 6 really pushed Mark to his 
                mental breaking point and showed more of the consequences of living in a superhero world. Ep 7 was the 
                episode with all the Invincibles and was honestly so cool. Ep 8 the final fight scene with 
                Conquest was stupid cool. Also Atom Eve is OP apparently.
