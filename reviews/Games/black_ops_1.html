                    Making this review because I just played some split screen zombies with Clint, Matthew and Hari and wow
                    the nostalgia playing Kino Der Toten and Five. Forgot how hard Kino was to play. And the crazy frenzy
                    when the hellhounds come on round 5. Was really fun showing Clint and Matthew the ropes. I was actually
                    quite good at zombies this time. Got to round 19 before I called it quits. I think one of my only 
                    criticisms is that when you die really late in the game there is no way to recover

                    Reflecting on the campaign as well. I haven't played it in so long. I think the last time I
                    played this was with Ben Wheatly actually. That mod was fun allowed us to play 2 player 
                    campaign. Before that it would have been when I was younger so I didn't actually know 
                    the historical significance of what I was playing and all the references to real life.
