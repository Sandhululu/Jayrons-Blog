                 Quite an old game so some of the combat was definitely outdated. Hopefully these issues have been 
                 resolved for Alan Wake 2, which I will play after I upgrade my computer. The strongest part of this game 
                 is the storytelling and the lore around it. This is something that I find that Remedy Entertainment 
                 do very well. In particular the story around the manuscripts and the fact that alan is playing
                 through his own story to be a great concept. Thinking back on this game I'm still confused lol. I should
                 probably play this game back or at least watch a yt vid before I play Alan Wake 2.
