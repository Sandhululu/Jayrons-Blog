                 Multiplayer in this game was fun lots of fond memories. Playing 1v1 sniper trickshots on nuketown 2025.
                 How OP the AN-94 and the MSMC were. Going round to Frankies house and playing together what a time
                 to be alive. I remember not prestiging for ages on this because I didn't see the point. Another memory
                 playing this with Ajay just before we started school. I'm always DSR gang.

                This is such a goated game for zombies. Town is great for training around and doing stupid shit. 
                Die Rise is the stupidest map ever it's impossible to know where the fuck you are going on that map. 
                High rounding with Ajay on town was peak got to like round 30ish I think. Been playing a lot
                of mob of the dead with Matthew and Hari. We have this map locked down. So efficient with how quick
                we get pack a punch. I remember first playing this map and being so confused when I was younger
                and even when I was older. After me and Matthew watched a youtube video it sorted us out. 
                Buried is also really good. Haven't quite got that locked in yet. We know what we are doing but it's 
                so hard to pack a punch because you need so much points and I always just lose them... We tried origins
                numerous times it's really fun but it's also ridiculously hard. I really wanna get the staffs but we keep
                dying thats the next one to lock in on. FUCK TRANSIT AND FUCK DIE RISE.
