                    This game is absolutely gorgeous playing this at home 4K with the surround sound system was absolutely
                    amazing. The game got infinitely better when I set it to Lethal. Where you have low heath and the 
                    enemies also the parrying is really hard but is so rewarding.

                    The story is very gripping basic but nonetheless very gripping. It raises questions on the 
                    Japanese Samurai code of honour. With Jin becoming more of the ghost and becoming dishonourable
                    you see in the game how that stretches his relationship with his uncle. Crazy that his own uncle
                    exiled him. Thinking about it the mongols defeat Jin as he completely lost his sense of 
                    japanese honour. But I guess that depends on whether you think that the japanese code of 
                    honour should be left in the past or remain in the present. The final fight had me absolutely shocked.
                    Either way you lose, if you defend your samurai honour you have to kill your only family. If you become
                    the ghost your uncle survives but you are dead to him.

                    The side missions in this game were so good as well. Ishikawa's sensei arc and the dangers of being a sensei
                    Yuriko thinking Jin is his father and seeking that lost love and the Lady Masako dealing with grief
                    in a very aggressive and angry manner. Can forget about the one on one duels as well so many good ones 
                    in this game. The amount of times I died but eventually won the duels lol. Top game cant wait for the
                    sequel. Should have a better PC by then so can play on 4K without frame gen and a fuck
                    tonne of latency though. Absolutely beautiful game 10/10 would recommend to a friend.
